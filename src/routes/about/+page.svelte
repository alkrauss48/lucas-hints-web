	<h1>About Lucas Hints</h1>

	<p>
		Welcome! <strong>Lucas Hints</strong> is an incredibly simple app designed to provide you with a
		little bit of guidance when you need it - without telling you the whole story.
	</p>
	<p>
		Wondering what to do next in your creative storytelling experience, or do you need a bit of
		advice with some real life decisions? <strong>Lucas Hints</strong> will help by giving you 3 unique
		icons across different categories. Want a fresh set? Just pull down to refresh - there's over 250,000
		unique combinations of icons!
	</p>
	<p>
		What do the icons actually mean? That's for you to interpret and decide! Now get out there and
		have some fun, and let your creativity flourish!
	</p>
	<h2>Why was this app built?</h2>
	<p>
		Hello! I'm Aaron, the creator of <strong>Lucas Hints</strong>. Lucas is my son. I love creative
		storytelling with my friends and family - but I know that sometimes, you need a little help to
		get your creative flow going. That's why this app exists.
	</p>
	<p>
		It's meant to give you just enough to think (and laugh) about what to do next - without telling
		you exactly what to do. It's just a few icons, right? You have to put the meaning together!
	</p>
